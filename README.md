# Gemini AI

## Project Overview

**Gemini AI** is a basic implementation of the Gemini AI, which allows users to interact with it by asking any text-based questions. This project utilizes the Gemini AI API provided by Google, making it simple to integrate AI capabilities for personal use.

## Description

In this project, users can input a text-based prompt, and the Gemini AI responds accordingly. The aim is to explore the basics of using the Gemini AI API, handling user input, and interacting with AI responses.

At this stage, the project is minimal and only covers basic functionality, allowing users to ask questions and receive AI-generated answers in real time.

## Future Upgrades

I plan to enhance this project in the upcoming months as I expand my skills. Some potential upgrades include:

- Adding voice input for user prompts.
- Expanding the AI capabilities to include context-aware responses.
- Implementing a more interactive UI/UX for better user experience.
- Enhancing API integration for better performance and more features.

## Technologies Used

- **Gemini AI API**: Provided by Google, this API is at the core of the project.
- **JavaScript/Node.js**: Handles the backend logic and API requests.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the basic user interface.
- **Future Stack Updates**: As I upgrade my skills, additional technologies will be incorporated into the project.
